# Allosaurus Run

Allosaurus Run is a minigame built using ActionScript, and Adobe/Macromedia Flash. You play as a spry Allosaurus, fleeing a T-Rex in hot pursuit. If you can find a Flash player to run this somehow...

## Why I built this

Allosaurus Run was my Capstone project for CS 110 at Queens U, as part of my Computing & Creative Arts Specialization. I was able to combine my visual arts background with my interest in animation & game design, using OOP principles to bring this all to life! 

## Next Steps

This was the very first app I built as a programmer, and I've come a long way since. While ActionScript & Flash may no longer be prominent web technologies, I am interested in seeing if I can rebuild a version of this using Vanilla JavaScript!
